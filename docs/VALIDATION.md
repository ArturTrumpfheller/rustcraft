# Slice 1 validation

Validated on 2026-10-20 in the Codex cloud environment: Debian 13 glibc x86-64, Rust 1.99.1, Bevy 0.20.0. This is not a Void Linux or Windows play-test report.

## Passed development checks

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked --workspace
cargo build --locked --workspace
```

All completed successfully. There were **16 passing tests**, with no failures or ignored tests (the library has no documentation tests):

- 11 `voxel_core` tests: exhaustive chunk indexing, bounds, negative coordinate boundaries and round trips including i32 limits, checked overflow, world lookup, fixed scene repeatability, empty/single/adjacent block geometry, all-axis inter-chunk culling, cavity faces, outward triangle winding and vertex attributes.
- 5 client tests: the real scene plugin creates four nonempty mesh entities and one material; click/Escape/focus cursor transitions; movement gating; normalized diagonal flight and reset; frame-time-independent mouse look and pitch clamping.

The tests execute engine-independent logic and actual Bevy ECS systems. They do not initialize a graphics backend.

## Passed graphical smoke check

The unmodified client was launched with `cargo run --locked -p rustcraft` in an isolated Xvfb X11 display using Mesa 25.0.7 **llvmpipe software Vulkan** (LLVM 19.1.7). Backend selection was supplied only to that local test process; the application does not hardcode Vulkan.

A screenshot was inspected: a lit, connected terraced voxel surface, stone landmark and sky are visible. A local XTest harness then verified:

1. A left click acquires the native X11 pointer grab.
2. Relative mouse input changes the rendered view.
3. WASD input changes the rendered view.
4. Escape releases the native pointer grab.
5. Movement keys after release leave the rendered image unchanged.
6. Focus loss releases capture; regaining focus does not recapture it.
7. A native window-close request exits the application successfully.

Xvfb emits expected display/settings warnings, and Bevy warns about the software adapter. This is functional rendering/input smoke coverage, not a performance benchmark or a guarantee for physical graphics drivers.

## Outstanding platform acceptance

- Native Void Linux glibc with the owner's graphics driver.
- A real Wayland session, including pointer locking and focus transitions.
- Native Windows MSVC compilation and GUI testing. The repository's GitHub Actions matrix is configured for Ubuntu and Windows; no remote CI result is claimed here.
- Manual resize, physical input feel, fullscreen behavior and supported GPU/driver combinations.

Follow the [manual test procedure](PLATFORMS.md#slice-1-manual-test). Full v0.1 gameplay is intentionally incomplete: collision/gravity, block interaction, seeded generation, hotbar and save/load are later slices.
